      <h2>About Me</h2>
      
      <!-- Content here -->
      <img class="profile" src="./assets/images/profile_pic_copy.jpeg"/>My name is Matthew Starr and welcome to my page.  I grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and lived there until I moved to Charlotte, North Carolina back in 2004.  
                    Some of my interests are playing guitar, video games and playing with electronics. I used to take my toys apart when I was a kid just to see how they worked and try to put them back together.  That didn't always go as planned.

                        It has always been easy to get along with all different kinds of people from assorted backrounds. So grocery retail is where I've spent the last 10 years working since customer service is a big part of that job.  However I have decided that I could use a change. That's why I jumped into the web developement field.  It's not easy but very interesting and keeps me on my toes.  I enjoy a good challenge.

                        Playing guitar comes from the creative side of me.  It is also a very hard skill to learn but with enough repetition and focus you could be playing songs in no time.  Alot of times learning how to play the guitar I was frustrated and wanted to quit but if I just walked away for a little bit of time and came back to it everything was fine.
